\title{Genetic parameters for selection}
\usage{
genpar(.data, GEN, REP, vars, K = 0.05, check = FALSE, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{The name of the object containing data.}

\item{GEN}{The column with the selected genotypes within the population.}

\item{REP}{The column with the repetitions (if any).}

\item{vars}{The column with the variable of interest.}

\item{K}{Selection pressure (Default 0.05).}

\item{check}{Logical argument. Checks the model's assumptions
statistical if the value is equal to TRUE.}

\item{verbose}{Logical argument. Runs the code silently if FALSE.}
}
\value{
A list containing the following components:

\item{Environmental variance (sigmaE)}{The environmental variance (sigmaE) represents
the variability in phenotypic traits attributable to environmental factors.
 This variance is important for understanding how environmental conditions
  influence the observed phenotype.}
\item{Genotypic variance (sigmaG)}{The genotypic variance (sigmaG) reflects the
variability in phenotypic traits attributable to genetic differences between
individuals. It is crucial for assessing the genetic potential of a population
 for a specific trait.}
\item{Phenotypic variance (sigmaP)}{The phenotypic variance (sigmaP) is the total
observed variability in the phenotype, which is the sum of environmental and
 genotypic variances. This measure helps understand the overall range of
 variation observed in a given dataset.}
\item{Environmental coefficient of variance (ECV)}{The environmental
coefficient of variance (ECV) is the ratio of environmental variance to the
mean of the phenotypic value, expressed as a percentage. It gives an idea of
the magnitude of environmental variation relative to the mean value.}
\item{Genotypic coefficient of variance (GCV)}{The genotypic coefficient of
variance (GCV) is the ratio of genotypic variance to the mean of the phenotypic
value, also expressed as a percentage. It is used to estimate how much genetic
 variability can be exploited for improving desirable traits.}
\item{Phenotypic coefficient of variance (PCV)}{The phenotypic coefficient of
variance (PCV) is the ratio of phenotypic variance to the mean of the phenotypic
value, expressed as a percentage. It provides insight into the overall impact
 of both genetic and environmental factors on the observed variation.}
\item{Heritability (h2b)}{Heritability (h2b) is the proportion of phenotypic
variance attributable to genotypic variance. It indicates the potential for
selecting specific traits within a population.}
\item{Genetic advance (GA)}{Genetic advance (GA) represents the amount of
genetic progress that can be achieved in one generation by selecting the best
individuals for specific traits.}
\item{Genetic advance as percentage of the mean (GAM)}{Genetic advance as a
percentage of the mean (GAM) is a measure of how much genetic progress
represents relative to the population's mean. This value helps assess the
effectiveness of selection strategies.}
